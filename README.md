ABCD_from_crystal_center_to_crystal_center: This is just a testing software, to check if my round trip matrix is self-consistent. 
ABCD_from_incoupling_position_to_crystal_center: This calculates the waist inside the crystal, if you give it the waist at the incoupling position. 
Absorption cross sections: This calculates the required power to absorb 10 photons in 3 gratings plus ionization for detection for 2 diff. cases. 
crystal_center_to_crystal_center: This Plots the waist at avery position within the cavity. 
round_trip_diff_starting_position: Generates the same plot as "crystal_center_to_crystal_center" but from a different starting position.
